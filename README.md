# XML

Extensible Markup Language.
Designed to store and transport data
designed to be both human and machine readable.

The main goal of xml is to transport data. It is not a programming language hence can nit be used for data structures and algorithms since it does not handle logic.
It bridges the gap between human and machine understanding and readability.

## File extension

XML is an open format. The filename extension of XML is .xml
